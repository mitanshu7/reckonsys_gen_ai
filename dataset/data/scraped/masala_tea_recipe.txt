Masala Tea Recipe Home Masala Tea Recipe My dialed down recipe Mitanshu Sukhwani 2025-06-07 Ingredients: 5 gms Taj Mahal
Tea 1.8 gms Sugar
Free stevia OR 9 gms madhur normal
sugar 1 gm Everest Tea
Masala 40 gms freshly boiled water, preferrably from Aquaguard . 100 gms Full Cream Milk
(6% fat minimum) . Instructions: Mix tea, sugar, and masala in a double wall insulated steel mug
with water. Steep for 4 minutes. Transfer the mix in a vessel you will boil the milk in. Add milk in the mug, swirl, and transfer the milk into the
vessel. Keep gas on full flame and bring to boil once, till a certain
amber color is achieved. If not, try edging. Strain and enjoy! Thoughts I believe it scales linearly for 2-3 times the output size,
beyond which I have never had to make tea. Tastes best with normal sugar :) Back to Home
