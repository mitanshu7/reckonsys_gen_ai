Tailscale on Kindle Home Tailscale on Kindle It’s a rite of passage to run tailscale on
weird devices. Mitanshu Sukhwani 2025-06-08 Please visit mitanshu7/tailscale_kual for the appropriate code. Prerequisites: Jailbroken Kindle. ( see ) KUAL installed. ( see ) USBNetworking hack installed and enabled. Set up ssh
keys for ease of use. Usage: Download the repository mentioned above. Get the latest tailscale binaries for the arm architecture from here . Or see
releases page for a version that worked for me. Place the tailscale and tailscaled binaries in the tailscale/bin folder of this (local)
repository. Place the tailscale folder into the extensions folder on your kindle. In the KUAL menu, start tailscaled first then start tailscale . You can find the url to login in the extensions/tailscale folder in tailscale_start_log.txt file, if this is a first time
setup. Copy the login url to a modern web browser and login using your
preferred SSO. After connecting the device should add the kindle to your Machines page on tailscale admin console. ( this ). Now you can see the (static) IP address assigned by Tailscale for
your machine. You can use this ip to connect to kindle. Note: Make sure the kindle screen is on, else the kindle sleeps
the wifi. Back to Home
