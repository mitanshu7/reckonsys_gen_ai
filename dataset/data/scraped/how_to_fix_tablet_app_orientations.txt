How to fix Tablet app Orientations Home How to fix Tablet app Orientations Free the portrait-locked apps Mitanshu Sukhwani 2025-06-07 Following is a copy of the Reddit
post by u/MishaalRahman : Tutorial : How to stop apps like Authy, Venmo
etc. from being locked to portrait mode on Android
tablets/foldables One of the most annoying parts about using most Android tablets or
foldables is being forced to flip the device over because an app doesn’t
support landscape mode. This is a big issue on the OPPO Find N2, for
example. Fortunately,
there’s a fix. Here’s how it works. If you aren’t familiar with this problem or don’t think it’s a big
deal, watch this part
of Michael Fisher’s OPPO Find N2 review . The Find N2 has a
“widebody” inner screen that defaults to landscape mode. As Michael
points out, lots of folks (myself included) think the “widebody”
approach to foldables is better. But as you can see, it’s not always
perfect. Apps like BeReal, Authy, Venmo, Zipcar, Lyft, Delta, Chase,
& Amex are locked to portrait mode, forcing you to rotate the phone
after unfolding it. This issue also affects tablets like the new OnePlus Pad, by the way!
In fact, this problem has affected large screen Android devices for
years now, and Google quietly implemented a way for OEMs to fix
this…though none of them are using it yet. Background But first, why does this happen? It’s not exactly Google/Android or
the OEMs’ faults. It’s more to do with the decisions of app developers,
as many apps just aren’t optimized for large screen devices. Now, Google has always recommended that developers design their apps
with responsive layouts that make full use of the screen space available
in both portrait and landscape orientations on large screen devices. But
they don’t mandate this. Given that traditional candybar phones dominate the market and
tablets/foldables are sold in far fewer quantities, it makes sense that
most Android apps are optimized for candybar phones in portrait mode.
Supporting other form factors requires additional work. It’s gotten
easier over the years to do so, but it’s still more work. What should devs whose apps aren’t landscape-optimized do when a
tablet user wants to use their app in that orientation? “Optimize the
app for large screens” is preferable but they may not have the
time/resources/sign-off. So to keep the app looking/working as intended,
just lock it to portrait mode! Setting the android:screenOrientation attribute to “portrait” on any activity will make Android rotate the
screen to portrait when that activity is visible. Apps like Authy,
BeReal, Venmo use this. There’s also an
API to programmatically change the orientation, which some use. It’s obviously not ideal that there are so many apps that aren’t
optimized for landscape/large screen devices. Forcing devs to support
them would be a huge burden and hard to justify given current market
share, though, so Google doesn’t do that. The solution That’s why Google made a solution that both respects that some devs
don’t want their apps to be stretched and lets OEMs decide how they want
apps to be shown. OEMs can override
apps’ orientation preferences and display them in a letterbox that
maintains the aspect ratio. This feature was added in Android 12, as I mentioned in my
Android 12L deep dive for Esper.io . My article also pointed out that
there’s a shell command that AOSP engineers can use to test this
feature. That’s what we’ll take advantage of here! All you have to do to fix this issue on your own device is to run a
command to tell Android to ignore apps’ orientation preferences on a
particular display. For the OnePlus Pad/OPPO Find N2’s main display, for
example, the command is as follows: adb shell wm set-ignore-orientation-request -d 0 true Display ID ‘0’ might not be the right display ID for your foldable’s
inner display, so you may need to substitute ‘0’ with another number.
Use the command adb shell cmd display get-displays to see
the list of displays. This command should take effect immediately, though you may need to
close out of an app and then relaunch it. Here are photos of the Venmo
app running in a letterbox on the OPPO
Find N2 and OnePlus
Pad after applying this fix. (📷 credits: Tim Schofield) As you can see, the Venmo app isn’t stretched out - respecting its
devs’ desire to have it be presented in a particular aspect ratio while
also letting you use it in a more natural orientation. The solid gray
background could be made better, but unfortunately, not on ColorOS. While Android 12 added letterboxing
customization —where to place the app (eg. left instead of center) or
what the background should look like—on some OEM forks of Android, the
letterboxing shell commands were removed, so you can’t adjust this
yourself. In any case, I hope this trick helps! Big thanks to @qbking77 for testing this
and sending me the photos. Try this out if you have a tablet or foldable
running Android 12 or later! If you’re running < Android 12, try the app Rotation
| Orientation Manager on Google Play (or a similar app). These apps
use Android’s Accessibility API to display an invisible, noninteractive
overlay that requests your desired orientation. It’s not perfect but it
may work for you! Last bit : If you’re wondering why OPPO/OnePlus
doesn’t use this feature, it could be they decided forced portrait
provides a better experience than a customized letterbox (I’d disagree
with that). Or it could be they just don’t know it exists! After all,
it’s not like OEMs magically know about every single little thing that
Google adds to each new Android version! They get told a lot of things,
but often still have to dig into each release to assess minor
changes/features like I do :) Back to Home
