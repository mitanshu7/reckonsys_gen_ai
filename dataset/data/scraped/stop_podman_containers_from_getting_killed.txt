Stop podman containers from getting killed Home Stop podman containers from getting killed Keep rootless Podman containers running
after logout or reboot Mitanshu Sukhwani 2025-06-06 Run the podman containers without a restart
policy. Issue command: loginctl enable-linger $user WARNING systemd support is deprecated in podman, see quadlets . Enable service using: podman generate systemd --files --name $container , where $container is your container id. In the service file, change [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target to [Install] WantedBy = default.target if not done already by the generated service. We can copy the file to ~/.config/systemd/user/container-foo.service If the directory doesnt exist, create it mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/ , copy the service
file cp container*service ~/.config/systemd/user/ , and then issue: systemctl --user daemon-reload Start a rootless container via systemctl --user start container-foo.service To persist reboots, also issue command: systemctl --user enable container-foo.service Stop a rootless container via systemctl --user stop container-foo.service Now the containers should live through the logout sessions (2) and
reboots (7) References rootless
