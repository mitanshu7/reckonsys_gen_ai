SSH into Android with Termux & Cloudflared Home SSH into Android with Termux & Cloudflared Turn your Android device into a remotely
accessible server Mitanshu Sukhwani 2025-07-31 I have been selfhosting for a couple of years, but every now and then
I find something that makes my day. Recently, I tried out Nebula , the
open-source Tailscale alternative
and found Termux , a terminal
emulator for Android, very useful to access common utilities like ping and ssh . I like to play around networking
on odd devices and had created Tailscale on
Kindle . Then I tried a similar approach as detailed on this github
gist, Tailscale without
root , but failed with Permission denied error. Not
knowing anything about Android API, I had to switch directions towards
my Cloudflared
+ Alpine Linux + Raspberri Pi Zero 2W setup. Here is a simple website
being served from my phone , How amazing is that?! (It may or may not show for you depending on my phone battery or time
of day XP) What You’ll Need An Android device with Termux installed A domain managed by Cloudflare Step 1: Setting Up
Cloudflared on Termux First, let’s install and configure Cloudflared on your Android
device. Install Cloudflared Open Termux and run: pkg upgrade pkg install cloudflared Create a Cloudflare Tunnel Visit https://one.dash.cloudflare.com Navigate to Networks -> Tunnels -> Create a tunnel Give your tunnel a memorable name and save it Look for the section that says “OR run the tunnel manually in your
current terminal session only” Copy the <TOKEN> that appears after cloudflared tunnel run --token Set Up the Service To ensure your tunnel runs reliably, we’ll set it up as a
service: # Create logging directory mkdir -p $PREFIX /var/service/cloudflared/log # Symlink logger ln -sf $PREFIX /share/termux-services/svlogger $PREFIX /var/service/cloudflared/log/run # Create the service run file nano $PREFIX /var/service/cloudflared/run In the nano editor, paste the following content (replace TOKEN with your actual token): #!/bin/bash exec cloudflared tunnel run --token TOKEN Make the file executable and start the service: chmod +x $PREFIX /var/service/cloudflared/run sv up cloudflared sv-enable cloudflared You can check if everything is working with: sv status cloudflared Log files for services are situated in $PREFIX/var/log/sv/<PKG>/ with the active log file
named “current”. cat $PREFIX /var/log/sv/cloudflared/current Step 2: Configure SSH on
Termux Now let’s set up the SSH server on your Android device. Install and Start SSH pkg install openssh sshd sv up sshd sv-enable sshd Find Your Username You’ll need this for connecting later: whoami The output will be something like u0_a264 . Set Up Authentication You have two options for authentication: Option 1: Password
Authentication Set a password for your user: passwd Option 2: SSH Key
Authentication (Recommended) From your PC, copy your public key. If you don’t have one, generate
a new SSH key first . # On your PC cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub Copy the output, then in Termux: nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste your public key and save the file. Step 3: Configure Cloudflare
Access Now we need to set up the public hostname and access policies. Create a Public Hostname In your Cloudflare dashboard, create a new Public Hostname: ssh.example.com (replace with your domain) Set the following properties: Service type: SSH URL: 127.0.0.1:8022 Set Up Access Control Go to Cloudflare Access → Applications Create a new application with these settings: Application name: ssh (or any name you prefer) Public hostname: ssh.example.com Add an access policy to allow your email address Browser rendering settings: SSH Step 4: Connect to Your Phone You’re now ready to SSH into your Android device! Via Browser Visit ssh.example.com in your web browser Authenticate using your email (as configured in Cloudflare
Access) Enter your Termux username (e.g., u0_a264 ) Provide either your password or paste your private SSH key You’re in! You now have full terminal access to your Android
device Making It Persistent To ensure your tunnel starts automatically when your phone boots: Install Termux:Boot from
F-Droid Follow the setup instructions to enable the service on boot Troubleshooting If you need to stop the SSH service: pkill sshd Check tunnel/sshd status: sv status cloudflared or sv status sshd View tunnel logs: Check the log directory we created earlier Security Considerations Always use strong passwords or SSH keys Regularly update Termux packages with pkg upgrade Consider limiting access policies in Cloudflare to specific IP
ranges if possible Conclusion You now have secure, remote access to your Android device from
anywhere in the world! References Termux Remote
