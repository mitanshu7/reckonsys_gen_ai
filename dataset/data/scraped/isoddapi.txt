IsOddApi Home IsOddApi A playful REST API to check if a number is
odd Mitanshu Sukhwani 2025-06-09 Backstory The other day isEven API made it
to the frontpage of Hacker
News and one
commenter requested the odd version of it. Well, I present to you IsOddApi ! Implementation The best part? It uses isEven
API in the backend and inverts the answer XD I saw this as a learning opportunity and took it. I got to use flask , a
lightweight WSGI web application framework. Given the very simple nature
of the API, I thought to package it all as a Docker container. You can
find the codes at mitanshu7/IsOddApi and mitanshu7/IsOddApiWebsite . The website uses The
smallest Docker image to serve static websites to make it lean . Outcome isOdd API is a RESTful API that returns json. API URL: https://isoddapi.onrender.com/api/ GET /isodd/<number>/ Returns whether a given number is odd. Allowed numbers depend on your
API tier. See Pricing below. URL Parameters number: the number you want to check Example https://isoddapi.onrender.com/api/isodd/7/ { "ad" : "1995 NISSAN Maxima, green, leather, loaded, CD, auto start, sunroof, 4-door, great condtion, NOT FOR SALE" , "isodd" : true } Back to Home
