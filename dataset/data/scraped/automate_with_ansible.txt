Automate with Ansible Home Automate with Ansible Hello IT. Did you try turning it on and off
again? Mitanshu Sukhwani 2025-06-09 I learned all about ansible ,
which automates the management of remote systems and controls their
desired state, from this fantastic YouTube Channel - LearnLinuxTV . Here
is the ansible playlist . The idea with ansible is to have a certain set of rules, which we
call Playbook, define how software gets installed on computer systems at
scale. Ansible environment On your Control Node, device from which you will be running the
playbook, you can install Ansible as follows: $ pipx install --include-deps ansible Confirm your installation by: $ ansible --version The Playbook is a simple YAML file. In an Ansible playbook, you can name your tasks, create groups for
specific tasks, act as a specific user, and run the tasks needed to
perform. - name : Update web servers hosts : webservers remote_user : root tasks : - name : Ensure apache is at the latest version ansible.builtin.yum : name : httpd state : latest Best part about using ansible is idempotency. Most Ansible modules
check whether the desired final state has already been achieved, and
exit without performing any actions if that state has been achieved, so
that repeating the task does not change the final state. You can also protect you sensitive data with Ansible
vault . Vault encrypts your sensitive data so you dont have to store
keys in plain text. While running the playbook, direct ansible to ask
you for vault to decrypt the data before running: ansible-playbook local.yml --ask-vault-pass --ask-become-pass --ask-become-pass helps you perform tasks that require
administrator privileges. Find my ansible configuration at mitanshu7/ansible_workstation . I highly recommend learning about ansible from the mentioned YouTube
