## Prep for the assignment:

### Learn async

- [x] https://realpython.com/python-async-features/
- [ ] https://realpython.com/async-io-python/

### Decide on which framework to use for async requests (aiohttp vs httpx)


[1] Makes a good point on how httpx has good ergonomics, the likes of requests. However, [2] provides more insight on the stability/maturity of aiohttp. For this exercise, I will implement async network calls using httpx and scale with aiohttp later.
